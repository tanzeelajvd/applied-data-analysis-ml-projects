# Soil Erosion Risk Prediction System

This project presents an **end-to-end soil erosion risk prediction system** that integrates data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and an interactive application interface.

The focus of the project is to demonstrate how **environmental features and soil imagery** can be combined within a structured machine learning pipeline to assess erosion risk in a practical and interpretable manner.

---

## Problem Overview

Soil erosion is influenced by multiple interacting factors such as terrain characteristics, vegetation indices, climatic conditions, and soil composition. Relying on a single data source often fails to capture this complexity.

This project aims to:
- analyze environmental and terrain-related features,
- learn predictive patterns using machine learning models,
- incorporate soil image understanding through deep learning,
- provide an interactive interface for experimentation and inference.

---

## Project Workflow

The project follows a modular and reproducible workflow:

### 1. Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
**`soil-erosion.ipynb`**
- Exploratory data analysis of environmental features
- Feature selection and transformation
- Correlation analysis and visualization
- Preparation of model-ready inputs

---

### 2. Model Training
Within the notebook:
- multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated,
- both lightweight and feature-rich configurations are explored,
- soil type information is incorporated into the learning process.

All models are **generated by running the notebook locally**, ensuring full reproducibility of results.

---

### 3. Soil Type Understanding from Images
A convolutional neural network is used to extract semantic information from soil images.

- Users may upload soil images to enrich predictions
- Image-based soil understanding complements tabular environmental data

This component is optional and designed to enhance interpretability rather than replace numeric inputs.

---

### 4. Interactive Application
**`app.py`**

An interactive application built with **Streamlit** allows users to:
- manually enter environmental feature values,
- optionally upload a soil image,
- switch between simplified and full-feature prediction modes,
- receive erosion risk predictions as human-readable categories.

The application dynamically uses models generated from the training pipeline.

---

## Dataset

Raw datasets used for experimentation and training are **not included in the repository** due to size constraints.

- The project is designed so datasets can be placed locally
- The focus is on methodology, modeling, and system design rather than data distribution
