# Loan Default Risk Prediction System

This project implements an **end-to-end loan default prediction system** that combines classical machine learning, feature preprocessing, and **model explainability using SHAP**, delivered through an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

The goal is to demonstrate how structured financial and demographic data can be transformed into **interpretable credit risk predictions**, with clear explanations of model behavior.

---

## Problem Overview

Loan default prediction is a critical task in financial risk management. Beyond accuracy, modern systems must also provide **transparent explanations** for their decisions in order to support trust, compliance, and decision-making.

This project aims to:
- predict the likelihood of loan default,
- validate input features rigorously before inference,
- explain model predictions using SHAP values,
- present results through an interactive web interface.

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Processing and Model Training
**`train_models.ipynb`**

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Dimensionality reduction and pipeline design

All models and preprocessing components are **generated by running the notebook locally**, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

---

### 2. Interactive Prediction Application
**`app.py`**

The Streamlit application allows users to:
- input customer demographic and financial information,
- validate inputs against the trained preprocessing pipeline,
- receive loan default predictions with probability estimates,
- view feature-level explanations using SHAP.

Predictions are presented as:
- **Low Risk of Default**
- **High Risk of Default**

with accompanying confidence scores.

---

### 3. Model Explainability (SHAP)

The application includes:
- SHAP-based feature contribution analysis
- Visual explanations showing how individual features influence predictions
- A clear link between input values and model behavior

This makes the system suitable for **risk analysis and interpretability-focused workflows**.

---

## Dataset

The datasets used for training and experimentation are **not included in the repository** due to size constraints.

- The project is designed so datasets can be placed locally
- Emphasis is placed on methodology, validation, and explainability rather than data distribution
