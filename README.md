# Applied Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of **end-to-end applied machine learning projects** focused on solving real-world problems using a combination of **data analysis, classical machine learning, and deep learning techniques**.

Each project is structured as a self-contained application, covering the complete workflow—from data exploration and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment-ready components. The emphasis is on practical problem-solving rather than isolated algorithms, reflecting how machine learning is used in real production and research settings.

The projects span multiple domains, including healthcare, finance, transportation, agriculture, and computer vision, and demonstrate how different ML approaches can be selected and integrated based on the nature of the problem and data.

Key characteristics of this repository:
- applied, problem-driven machine learning use cases,
- integration of data analysis with modeling and inference,
- use of both classical ML and deep learning where appropriate,
- reproducible and modular project structures,
- selected projects implemented as lightweight web applications using Flask.

This repository is intended to showcase practical ML skills, system-level thinking, and the ability to translate data and models into usable applications.
